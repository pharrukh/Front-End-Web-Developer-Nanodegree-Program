Now I would like to look at bindings.

The plan is to use table storage as a persistance layer.
I used mixed approach of bindings and SDKs:

The code is <a href="https://github.com/pharrukh/intro-to-az-func/tree/e2c7e3417204023fa749dfddcdf61333c3257703">here</a>.

One can of course use the library to manage the input/output operations.
In non-trivial cases it is the only way.
When one need, for instance, use various blob types.
