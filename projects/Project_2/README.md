# My First Single Page Application

## Overview

Complexity of the project is in interacting with DOM.
I cut the corners and tried to just meet the requirements.
I am a fulltime-working farther and write this code in the fringe of focussed time that I have between 4 and 8 in the morning.

## Complex Feature

The interesting part is `IntersectionObserver`, as from the moment I learned basics of web development in 2013 at university, there have been interesting changes that both make the development more complex and easier.

So far I enjoy the course, although I failed my initial goal of passing within one month.
However I am still on track to finish it within the next 21 days, as the rest of the course is mostly JS, that I know much better than CSS, HTML and DOM.
